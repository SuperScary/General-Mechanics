# General Mechanics

*A comprehensive technology mod for Minecraft that brings real-world engineering, chemistry, and industrial processes to your world.*

## Philosophy

General Mechanics isn't just another technology mod‚Äîit's an ambitious attempt to create one of the most realistic, scientifically accurate, and educationally valuable mods in the Minecraft ecosystem. Our goal is to bridge the gap between virtual engineering and real-world knowledge, providing players with an authentic experience that mirrors actual industrial processes, chemical reactions, and material science.

## Core Design Principles

### üî¨ Scientific Accuracy
Every element, compound, and process in General Mechanics is based on real-world science. From the complete periodic table with accurate atomic weights and properties to realistic chemical formulas for plastics, we strive for authenticity that would make a chemistry professor proud.

### Industrial Realism
Our machines and processes are inspired by actual industrial equipment and manufacturing techniques. Players will encounter familiar concepts from real-world factories, refineries, and chemical plants, making the mod not just fun but educational.

### Material Science Focus
Understanding materials is fundamental to engineering. General Mechanics introduces a comprehensive material system where:
- **Elements** have realistic properties, colors, and behaviors
- **Alloys** combine elements with scientifically accurate compositions
- **Polymers** follow real chemical structures and manufacturing processes
- **Composites** demonstrate how different materials work together

### Visual Authenticity
Every item, block, and machine is designed to reflect its real-world counterpart. Element colors match their actual appearance, machines look like industrial equipment, and processes follow logical visual cues that help players understand what's happening.

## Key Features

### Complete Periodic Table
- All 118 known elements with accurate atomic numbers, symbols, and weights
